# Welcome to Learning Hungarian!

This site documents and supports my journey to learn the Hungarian language. Here you'll find lessons, interactive exercises, and resources as I progress from beginner to advanced topics.

## About This Project
- **Goal:** To create a structured, interactive, and open resource for learning Hungarian, starting from the basics and expanding over time.
- **Approach:** Each lesson will be added as a new page, with interactive content where possible.
