# Learning Hungarian

This repository documents and supports a journey to learn the Hungarian language, using GitHub Pages for publishing interactive lessons and resources.

## Project Structure
- **Landing Page:** `index.md` introduces the project and links to the first lesson.
- **Lessons:** Each lesson is a separate page. Interactive lessons (like vowel sounds) are in `/docs` as standalone HTML files.
- **Posts:** The `_posts` directory is reserved for blog-style updates or additional content.
- **Configuration:** `_config.yml` uses the `minima` theme. The site builds from the root directory.

## How to Add a New Lesson
1. **Create a new Markdown or HTML file** in the root or `/docs` directory.
2. **Add a link to the new lesson** on the landing page (`index.md`) or in the navigation section.
3. **For interactive content**, use standalone HTML in `/docs`.
4. **Commit and push** your changes. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild the site.

## Contributing
- Fork the repository and submit a pull request for new lessons, corrections, or improvements.
